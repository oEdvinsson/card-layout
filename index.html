                        <p>Hi there! My name is Oscar Edvinsson, and I'm a junior web developer with a passion for creating functional and visually appealing websites. Although I don't have any previous work experience as a web developer, I've spent the past six months honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React through online courses and personal projects. I believe that my passion for learning and my ability to work independently make me a strong candidate for any web development project. I'm constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills, and I'm eager to take on any project that comes my way. One of the things that I love about web development is the opportunity to collaborate with others and bring ideas to life. I'm a strong communicator and team player, and I believe that open communication and feedback are crucial for the success of any project.<br><br>

                        As someone who has worked in the business and financial advising industry, I understand the importance of creating functional and visually appealing websites that convey a sense of professionalism and credibility. I believe that my background in business and finance gives me a unique perspective on web development and allows me to understand the needs of businesses and clients.<br><br>
                        
                        Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio website. Please feel free to browse my projects and reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential project. I'm excited to begin my career as a web developer and can't wait to see where this journey takes me!</p>
